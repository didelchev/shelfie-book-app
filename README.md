## Planning 
I Started the project by drawing a wireframe on Excalidraw. The app consists of the following pages:

* Login: Allows users to log in to their accounts.
* Register: Enables users to create new account.
* Browse Books: Displays a book catalog with the filter options to di
* Single Book: Shows detailed information about a specific book. Users can add books to their library by clicking the "Add to Library" button and categorize them as "Read," "Currently Reading," or "Wishlist." If a book is already in the library, the user can view its current category instead of the default "Add to Library" button.
* Profile Page: Allows logged-in users to see their profile, with their profile image, bio, their book stats. They can also view all the books they have added to a specific category (Read, Currently Reading, To-Read)
